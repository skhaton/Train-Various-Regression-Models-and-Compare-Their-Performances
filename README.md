# Train-Various-Regression-Models-and-Compare-Their-Performances

In this code, I trained various regression models and compared their performances. I trained, tested, and evaluated individual models as well as ensemble models. My goal was to train a machine learning model that predicts the price of an Airbnb listing. 

Here is a steps of what I did: 
- Build your DataFrame and define your ML problem:
- Load the Airbnb "listings" data set
- Define the label - what are you predicting?
- Identify the features
- Create labeled examples from the data set.
- Split the data into training and test data sets.
- Train, test and evaluate two individual regressors.
- Use the stacking ensemble method to train the same regressors.
- Train, test and evaluate Gradient Boosted Decision Trees.
- Train, test and evaluate Random Forest.
- Visualize and compare the performance of all of the models
